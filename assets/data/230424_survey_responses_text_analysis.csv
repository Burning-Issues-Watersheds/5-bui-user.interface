What is the role of hyporheic flow through wildfire-deposited or reworked sediments in stream beds for enhancing or buffering elevated constituent loading in streams? Wildfires alter streambed sediments through aggradation, incision, and stabilization phases controlled by links between hydroclimatic conditions and geomorphic processes.

Justification: Up to 96% of river ecosystem respiration is associated with hyporheic exchange. This process is impacted by fires through changes in the form of organic matter for example PyOM; and changes in amount and type of other nutrients for example N,P; and changes in hydrologic processes that control hyporheic exchange such as erosion/sedimentation associated with wildfires.  These complex interactions have not been studied, but likely have strong controls over wildfire impacts on water quality and nutrient cycling.



What are the relationships between vegetation type, wildfire intensity, time since fires, and  the character of OM and other nutrients sourced to rivers?  Justification: As noted above, riverine nutrient cycling can be very important to watershed function, and changes in the character of OM and other nutrients delivered to rivers will be strongly impacted by wildfires. The character of PyOM likely exhibits chemical signatures related to the factors listed above and maybe others that in turn will impact rates of biogeochemical reactions in river systems, but systematic understanding of these relationships is lacking. 

","Numerical models of watersheds provide a potential framework within which understanding can be integrated and hypotheses can be formulated and tested.

5/7/2021 11:55:04,bq012,"Nutrient Cycling, Functional Diversity, Food Web / Trophic Dynamics, Water Quality","Addressing regional variation in biogeochemical responses would reveal underlying causes and synergisms of wildfire impacts to biogeochemical cycling. For example, high gradient, fire-excluded, coniferous streams with snow melt, perhaps the most destructive combination, would be expected to produce a very different response than low gradient, deciduous streams with a summer rainy season. Teasing apart these landscape scale (and continental scale) drivers, perhaps, could help promote basic principles

Additionally, if these flux if composed of bioavailable species it can impact aquatic ecology . Therefore, first we need a better understanding of if/how this flux of P impacts ecosystem structure and/or function, especially since it may be a primary or co-limiting nutrient. Secondly, we need to identify what chemical species are moving through these environmental fluxes using a variety of techniques such as fractionation schemes, NMR, XANES, etc. used a fractionation scheme to identify speciation, but more advanced techniques, such as NMR, XAS, are rarely used in wildfire research even though they are increasingly being used in soil science and other fields.

Changes in the flow-paths or residence time of water in the catchment, as well as the hydrologic regime, are likely to exert first-order controls on biogeochemical cycling in watersheds. However, it remains uncertain how various wildfire characteristics, catchment characteristics, post-fire precipitation, and runoff pathways interact to impact the retention and/or export of chemical elements.
Vertical and lateral exchanges of water along the river corridor fundamentally determine downstream biogeochemistry and, therefore, aquatic ecosystem health and source water supply. Wildfires have the potential to influence the bioavailability and reactivity of chemical elements during the combustion process   However, the long-term fate and bioavailability of pyrogenically altered elements as they are transported from burned headwaters to downstream rivers remains highly uncertain, which hampers our ability to develop predictive models.","The most important pathway to integrated, trans-disciplinary science is the development of committed research teams that will work together to frame the problems they will collaboratively address. This necessitates collaborators who are committed to investing the necessary time to the joint learning process financial investments and commitments by the team members to working 
Given the need for long-term time investments to develop trans-disciplinary collaborative teams, an initial pathway forward may be to develop and suggest guidelines for methods of data collection and development of metadata to facilitate integration of often disparate data sets. While this cannot replace the need for truly collaborative trans-disciplinary teams, it may enable future investments in research by illustrating to greater value from integration across disciplines.","The random character of wildfires generally precludes the design of tightly controlled watershed studies. Thus, the lack of pre-fire data creates substantial challenges for disentangling the effects from wildfires from the local, background variability in biogeochemical cycling. 
The effects of wildfires on the mechanisms controlling hydrology and biochemistry in the river corridor are complex and will require substantial long-term funding to enable collection of sufficient data to develop models from reaction- to basin-scale. However, even then, a substantial roadblock will be the transferability of the developed knowledge to other regions and within regions given non-stationary climate. "

How do immediate post-fire fluxes compare to pre-fire fluxes?

Wildfires alter the lateral transfer and in-stream export of material from burned catchments by enhancing overland flow, erosion, and mobilization of carbon and nutrients to the stream channel.  It also remains unclear how watershed conditions pre-fire may provide a blueprint for the hydrologic response, recovery, and associated material export, post-fire.

What are the best analytical approaches for quantifying pyrogenic carbon?  Can a multiproxy approach expand the analytical window for detecting wildfire in-stream and in the sedimentary record?

Wildfires produce charcoal and other thermally altered residues that vary size, mobility, and reactivity, thereby creating multiple pyrogenic signals in-stream and upon delivery and accumulation in sediments. Multiproxy studies have also been cited as a necessary step to improve our understanding of how sedimentary charcoal records relate to wildfire history 











","Nomenclature used to describe pyrogenic carbon has evolved alongside the methods we use to characterize this critical carbon fraction and definitions vary among scientific disciplines.  Since the use of specific scientific language promotes efficient communication within and among disciplines, the use of clear and consistent definitions to describe pyrogenic carbon must be emphasized.  Analytical windows for methods used to quantify pyrogenic carbon must be precisely articulated to avoid the confusion that results from propagation of poorly defined terminology.  From an analytical perspective, the incorporation of pyrogenic carbon standards is also advisable.

Efficient integration of fire science across scientific disciplines requires that the right samples, in sufficient amounts, are collected at the right time.  I am currently involved in a few studies where my collaborators are not experts on the organic geochemical analyses conducted in my lab, but they were able to collect field samples on my behalf because I was able to provide clean supplies and sufficient instruction for collecting water samples.  I do not have a peer-reviewed citation to support this perspective, but I believe that devising an ideal “sampling scheme” complete with protocols, supply lists, and perhaps even pre-assembled sampling kits so we are ready-to-go when unpredictable wildfire and storm events occur.  One of the main challenges is making the sampling process easy for on-site researchers, so lab-intensive analyses can occur to support field-based measurements and observations.


","Collecting simultaneous in-stream (suspended in river channel) and depositional data (alluvial fans, coastal basins, lakes) will allow us to link contemporaneous wildfire activity and hydrologic events within the region to patterns observed within the sedimentary record.  Calibration studies are essential for contextualizing modern wildfire activity within historic and geologic fire regimes.  Success in achieving this goal requires improved communication and collaboration across scientific disciplines (see answers to previous topic).

Given the unpredictable nature of wildfire, its biogeochemical effects in terrestrial and marine environments are extremely difficult and logistically challenging to capture in real time.  Sensor data can be used to safely acquire biogeochemical data during and immediately after fire, but proper calibration of these sensors determines their utility in this kind of work.  Funding and personnel support for capturing wildfire events is needed a priori – Even applying for an NSF RAPID proposal can be too slow for getting a modest amount of support needed to simply get to field sites and grab samples in a timely manner.  Again, I do not have a peer-reviewed citation to support this perspective – Mainly from personal experience.

Most of our knowledge pertains to the hydrologic response of individual fire events. Consequently, we can often make an educated prediction of how a watershed may respond given a fire. However, we have much less ability to predict how watershed hydrology will change in the future, as most such studies only incorporate climate change. Yet we know that climate change doesn’t just affect hydrologic processes such as snowmelt, but also vegetation productivity/transpiration, as well as vegetation fire regimes. Within the ecology community, there has been some work to understand how fire regimes are likely to change with a changing climate, but the implications of these types of changes on hydrology is a relatively untouched area.  had an interesting empirical study that showed that across the Western U.S., the long-term effects of wildfire on annual streamflow ranged from 2% to 14% across ecoregions. This estimate represents a significant amount of streamflow for water-limited regions. However, it is unclear how these values may change as wildfire regimes are altered with climate change, as there are likely scenarios where streamflow both increases and decreases depending on the region. In addition, there is the potential that streamflow effects may vary depending on the timescale analyzed, as climate change can have different short and long-term effects on fire. Higher temperatures associated with climate change can increase fuel aridity in already-established vegetation, increasing the potential for burning in the short-term. But higher temperatures can also decrease vegetation productivity in areas that are water-limited, increasing the time interval between fires and decreasing fire in the long-term. We need to better understand how change in fire regimes such as these will affect and be affected by watershed hydrology.

Another pressing need is to identify baseline/historical hydrologic conditions in watersheds where present-day vegetation and fire regimes are substantially different from what they were over a century ago prior to active fire suppression/management. An example of this is the southern Sierra Nevada, which is overstocked due to fire suppression and where we are attempting to assess what the effects of forest restoration and the reintroduction of a natural fire regime may have on streamflow and water supplies. Although there is often interest in evaluating changes in hydrology relative to current conditions, I would argue that the most appropriate comparison is with the ‘quasi-equilibrium’, low-severity fire, baseline conditions, even if it unrealistic that they will ever again be achieved due to climate change, changes in management practices. Perhaps more importantly, understanding hydrologic functioning under baseline conditions may provide a better indicator of biogeochemistry and sediment production in a watershed, compared to fire suppressed watershed. Experiments that attempt to reestablish a natural hydrologic regime, such as in the Illilouette Creek Basin in Yosemite National Park, can provide much needed knowledge of how the restoration of fire regimes may impact hydrology.

","• I think coupled models can be an approach to integrate fire science among various disciplines.
• Coupled models provide a direct connection between the research in various scientific disciplines and fire and allows the bidirectional exchange of ideas to and from those disciplines.
• RHESSys-WMFire, a watershed-scale coupled ecohydrologic and fire spread model, is an example of a watershed-scale model that can bridge that gap between hydrology, ecology and fire ecology, but more coupled models are needed with different emphases.


","One of the biggest challenges with coupled models that incorporate fire is the limited data needed to support calibration of long-term fire behavior.
There is frequently limited data on natural fire return intervals, fire size, etc. to help guide model evaluation.
Further, modern fire regimes are heavily influenced by management in the form of fire suppression. Thus, incorporating fire into the long-term models can necessitate modeling management decision making.

5/28/2021 18:01:17,bq023,"Water Quality, Water Routing, Hillslope Hydrology, Sediment Transport","How does the sediment transport cascade evolve after wildfire? Particle and particle associated transport is a major pathway for the redistribution and efflux of particulate and hydrophobic compounds after fire. Changes in source, transport lengths, and storage times, the sediment cascade plays a dominant role in controlling the redistribution of these compounds after fire, and likely the biogeochemical cycling of high gradient watersheds with intensive fire regimes.

How does hydrologic connectivity evolve after wildfire? The reactive transport pathways of both dissolved and particulate materials through watersheds can be dramatically altered by wildfire impacts on interception, infiltration, surface roughness, and evapotranspiration. Resultant increased rainfall partitioning to runoff after fire can dramatically decrease surface to subsurface hydrologic connectivity, while dramatically increasing surface connectivity between the hillslope and channel, with large potential impacts on biogeochemical cycling across a broad range of temporal scales.

Although advancement of interdisciplinary funding and networks, integration of fundamental scientists into applied research problems, and the availability and framework to support open and harmonized data have all advanced, problems remain, lack of funding, and progress on each of these fronts is essential for achieving integrated fire-system understanding.




","Lack of multi-parameter, high resolution monitoring data, particularly over long time scales.
Insufficient communication and data sharing between researchers operating within given disciplines or scales.
Lack of connectivity between modeling efforts between disciplines and scales.

Lack of data on the wildfire system has been ameliorated to some extent by the proliferation of remote sensing products (for a review on one particular corner of remote sensing applications to fire science). However, high-resolution data sets, particularly those including the contemporaneous monitoring of multiple parameters requires to further interdisciplinary understanding, and those collected over long time periods, remain relatively scarce. Modeling efforts also would benefit from increasing integration across disciplines, as we have seen in ecohydrologic modeling over the past decades.

Wildfires can affect soils by raising pH and changing the availability of nutrients. This can impact how microbes process N and the emissions they produce including nitric oxide, NO; precursor for tropospheric ozone formation, and nitrous oxide, N2O; powerful greenhouse gas.

In regions with short intervals between fires, such as the Mediterranean, they can lead to significant soil degradation, limiting the capacity to support vegetation and enhancing vulnerability to further fires. This can mean that, in the long-term, fire episodes can dominate soil erosion and the mobilization and transport of sediment, carbon and nutrients; and that these fire-prone forests and natural areas might not provide the hydrological ecosystem services expected by forest managers and land-use planners, such as soil protection and water quality regulation

How do fire and watershed characteristics determine post-fire impacts?
At smaller scales, the interaction between fire and topographic characteristics – in the way they impact hydrological and sediment connectivity – can be linked with the location of hotspots for erosion and contaminant mobilization; therefore, a small but well-connected fire might have greater impacts for sediment transport than a large fire in a poorly connected watershed. Understanding and mapping these connectivity patterns might help the development of more efficient ways to implement post-fire emergency erosion control measures.



","fund collaboration networks of researchers from different areas, focusing specifically on fire sciences COST Action FireLinks in Europe;
use these networks to organize targeted meetings on specific topics, fire risk prediction, water quality impacts resulting in join papers, commentaries, policy briefs etc;
when these networks exist, researchers can take advantage of existing collaborations to apply for funding in multi-disciplinary project proposals dealing with fire science.

My comments come from our experience in Europe with COST Action Connecteur, where we managed to bring together scientists from different topics and managers to present our recommendations to study and manage the impacts of fire on water quality. The creation of this network greatly facilitated building multidisciplinary project proposals to address these issues, which we found were well received, and at the EU level, specifically requested, by funding agencies.

","Different fire science topics are considered as subset of other disciplines more than as part of fire science, e.g. fire weather risk as part of climatology while post-fire hydrology as part of the hydrological sciences;
there are limited opportunities for scientists working in fire to interact and talk specifically about this topic, although this is improving in recent years;
even when interaction opportunities occur, scientists tend to keep to subgroups of their own disciplines, and crossing inter-disciplinary boundaries remain, in my experience, rare.
These comments stem directly from my reply to Topic 1, and our experience in trying to address these issues with the creation of COST Action FireLinks in Europe and the roadblocks we encountered. Even inside a Fire Science network action with a specific aim, and funding, to promote the interaction between different aspects of fire science, Working Groups are divided by other scientific topics, WG1: climate sciences, WG2: plant biology and scientists tend to interact little outside of their chosen WGs, even when actively prompted to.

Research is well advanced in upland erosion following wildfire. However, it is not clear how sediment, ash and char that are detached on burned hill slopes are routed through the stream system. Recent modeling has suggested that in higher order streams downstream from fires, there tends to be net deposition of sediment following a wildfire. In an undisturbed watershed, however, there is little sediment delivered to the streams but channel and bank erosion tend to be sources of sediment. Is this sediment from a fire that had occurred in the past decades, or is it from other sources? How long does it take a channel to flush through post fire sediment? The same questions apply to inorganic ash and organic char that is delivered to the channel immediately post fire. How much is deposited and later re entrained into the stream, and how much is delivered with the same event that washed it from the hill? 

The second question: What are the factors that combine to cause debris flows after a wildfire? In some landscapes, sediment from debris flows exceeds sediment from upland erosion. The USGS has some regression equations to estimate the likelihood of debris flows occurring, and the volume of debris flows on a landscape scale. However, their models are not able to identify where on the landscape the debris flows are likely to occur. There is a better need to understand the hydrology associated with debris flows, Geologic or soil properties that are more likely to be associated with debris flows, and the role of topography on debris flows. Also, what sort of upland conditions are likely to generate downslope debris flows? I have witnessed debris flows aggravated by wildfire landscapes as well as upland cropland watersheds, suggesting that this area is ripe for research leading to better understanding the conditions that are likely to result in debris flows. As debris flows can be deadly, there is a societal need to better understand these events.","For the sediment and ash delivery, downstream delivery of sediment and ash needs to e monitored and linked to burn severity distribution, soils and topography within the upland waterheds, across a range of climatic, geologic and topographic landscapes.  


For the debris flow modeling: Detailed field surveys of debris flows and their upstream basins need to be carried out and linked to estimates of the rainfall or snowmelt events that caused them. Rainfall may need to be estimate by radar as rain gage data are unlikely to be available across the landscape where debris flows may occur.

What are the relationships between wildfire regimes and the evolution and health of aquatic ecosystems across the world? Only a limited number of studies have closely looked at these relationships over limited extents and we don't know what they are in many places of the world that are prone to burning. Given the role of healthy aquatic ecosystems for water security, addressing this question will allow for the creation of baselines to further monitor how water security might suffer from excessive fire activity.
What is the risk to human and aquatic ecosystem health posed by WUI-fires leachates? WUIs are a preferential area for wildfire disasters to happen, and the combustion of man-made material, such as plastic, can compromise community water supply. But how and to what extent (in time and space) these combustion by-products (list to be established) can run off and pose water security issues is unknown at the moment. As WUI fires will likely increase, it is essential that we get an idea of the toxicants that reach downstream communities and ecosystems.

I explain this disconnect focusing on fire-induced soil heating. A pathway to better integrating fire science across disciplines is to create more opportunity for fire scientists and fire impact scientists to engage, to facilitate fire impact scientists, doing post-fire studies to see and experience and learn about fire in the field and to encourage post-fire scientists to include fire metrics: rate of spread, fire intensity, residence time, but also fire danger classification like the FWI indices in their research publications.","The lack of attention for fire itself in post-fire studies. 
The fact that many post-fire studies are focusing on burned areas alone (like studying the amount of post-fire erosion without regarding pre-fire values) instead of comparing burned and unburned. More work on mechanistic understanding of changes observed can help shed light on integrative impacts. 
Little collaboration between researchers of various disciplines is also a roadblock. It is a lot of effort to organize controlled/experimental fires - facilitating multiple teams to work on the same fires can greatly help interdisciplinary learning and understanding. This would need an exchange of experts facility, or someone/an entity linking researchers to eachother or to fire managers conducting planned burns. Maybe the Nature Conservancy can play a role in this with the TREX camps they organize - those camps focus on burning but if they would 'adopt' researchers that would be a fantastic way of connecting researchers of various disciplines to study integrated fire effects in a holistic way "

In my opinion, the critical link between wild land fire effects and biogeocehemical cycling resides in changes to residence time, or reaction time of water moving through fire affected catchments, which is governed by multiple water balance changes and runoff - infiltration conditions.","In my opinion, the discipline missing in this survey is wildland fire behavior science.

","From the hydrological and biogeochemical science perspective the two biggest road blocks are: 
In my opinion and what I can tell from literature and proposal calls, wildland fire is too often viewed as a hydrologic and biogeochemical disturbance.  But the vast majority of western ecosystems are 'fire-dependent'.  This means that fire is not a disturbance, but actually a creative force on the ecosystem and therefore the watershed response to wild land fire.  Even the phrase 'wildfire' is probably a missclassification here.  I think what should be studied is 'wild land fire' , fire taking place on the wild lands, which encompasses both wildfire ,uncontrolled high severity fire, and controlled or managed prescribed fire, generally low severity.   
The inclusion of indigenous burn practices.  Like most wildland fires indigenous burn practices have been severely suppressed.  However, these practices served multiple purposes, and often for specific management objectives.   How this is included as we grapple with role of wild land fire in the west will likely in large part determine at large societal understanding of the role and acceptance of fire, including affects to hydrology and biogeochemistry.

Next, we need to understand that putting fire into these watersheds should be done under our control so that watersheds can burn with the least adverse impacts. Mechanical treatments such as thinnings and mastication only partially address the mitigation of adverse effects; prescribed fire is a more ecologically viable tool to use to keep watersheds ecologically intact  ",More research and education,Lack of commitment by government agencies to adequately inform the public that a fire that is suppressed today could actually have created a fuelbreak if it had been left to burn under acceptable weather conditions.
