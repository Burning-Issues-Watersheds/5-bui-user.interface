    "text": "This is an exploratory data analysis (flesh out later)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur initial dataset contains answers from 67 participants to the following questions:\nResearch Areas: Which research area do you identify with? Choose all that apply\nPressing questions: Articulate what are 2 of the most pressing questions that need to be addressed to further our understanding of wildfire impacts on biogeochemical cycling in watersheds.\nThe datafile is organized in long format with three columns for the variables: Unique Identifier “ID”, “question” and “answers”. The original excel file was saved as CSV-UTF-8 for text analysis purposes.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    ID \n    Question type \n    Answers \n  \n \n\n  \n    IA0001 \n    pressing-q \n    better understanding of the temporal scales of the different impacts as well as their potential interactions movement of materials ash, pyrogenic carbon, eroded soil between compartments  from hillslopes to the hydrological network as well as physical and biological alterations of those during the transport \n  \n  \n    IA0002 \n    pressing-q \n    How are flow pathways affected by wildfires  change of hydrological processes beyond vegetation removal?\nHow long do changes in hydrology and biogeochemistry last? including importance of forest disturbance history \n  \n  \n    IA0003 \n    pressing-q \n    How important are deeper groundwater flowpaths for prolonging elevated nutrient yields in burned watersheds? The vast majority of post-wildfire studies on biogeochemical cycling have focused on surface or shallow flowpaths, yet post-fire geochemical tracers indicate elevated contributions from deeper bedrock flowpaths during some hydroclimatic conditions Murphy  2018.\nWhat is the role of hyporheic flow through wildfire-deposited or reworked sediments in stream beds for enhancing or buffering elevated constituent loading in streams? Wildfires alter streambed sediments through aggradation, incision, and stabilization phases controlled by links between hydroclimatic conditions and geomorphic processes Moody, 2017. Despite the ubiquity of changes in streambed sediments, we know little about how these streambed changes and associated alteration of hyporheic flow changes biogeochemical cycling. \n  \n  \n    IA0001 \n    research-a \n    Nutrient Cycling, Pyrogenic Organic Matter, Soil Stability, Quality, Mineralogy, Pyrogenic Organic Matter Transport, Fluxes, Water Quality, Watershed Management \n  \n  \n    IA0002 \n    research-a \n    Water Routing, Hillslope Hydrology, Surface Water – Groundwater Interactions, Hydrological Modeling \n  \n  \n    IA0003 \n    research-a \n    Water Routing, Hillslope Hydrology, Hydrological Modeling \n  \n  \n    IA0004 \n    research-a \n    Pyrogenic Organic Matter, Pyrogenic Organic Matter Transport, Fluxes, Pyrogenic Organic Matter Method Development, Biogeochemical Modeling, Successional Dynamics, Ecological Resilience, Ecological Modeling \n  \n  \n    FALSE \n    FALSE \n    FALSE \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTokenization is the process of separating every single word contained in an answer and creating a new data file that will contain as many rows as total words in the original dataset.\nFor this part we are going to separate the answers for the first two questions in two data sets. This is because the research area answers easier to analyze than those for the pressing questions. The research area answers are separated by commas and contain no filler words (due to the format used for the original question in the google form).\n\n#For research area questions\nra_dat <- t_df%>%filter(question==\"research-a\")\n\n#For pressing questions\npq_dat <- t_df%>%filter(question==\"pressing-q\")\n\nLet’s use wordclouds to visualize the ouput of tokenizing the research area dataset. I had to adjust the size of the words using the scale parameter (maximum size = 4 by default). Otherwise certain long words would not be fit into the plot (see stackoverflow answer)\n\n\n\n\n\nPressing questions answers requires an extra step. We need to remove “filler words” a.k.a. stop words (e.g., a, the, this…). We also need to deal with plurals and singulars of the same word.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Stop word \n    Lexicon \n  \n \n\n  \n    a \n    SMART \n  \n  \n    a's \n    SMART \n  \n  \n    able \n    SMART \n  \n  \n    about \n    SMART \n  \n  \n    above \n    SMART \n  \n  \n    according \n    SMART \n  \n  \n    you \n    onix \n  \n  \n    young \n    onix \n  \n  \n    younger \n    onix \n  \n  \n    youngest \n    onix \n  \n  \n    your \n    onix \n  \n  \n    yours \n    onix \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nMore info about lexicons and text categorization can be found here\nLet’s use wordclouds again to see the difference between the raw answers and “cleaned” answers for the pressing questions topic.\n\npq_tokens <- pq_dat %>% \n  unnest_tokens(output = word, input = answers)%>%\n  anti_join(stop_words, by = \"word\")%>%\n  filter(str_detect(word,\"[:alpha:]\"))%>%\n  distinct() %>% \n  count(word, sort = FALSE) %>% \n  mutate(length = nchar(word)) \nhead(pq_tokens)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  word            n length\n  <chr>       <int>  <int>\n1 2017a           1      5\n2 21st            1      4\n3 ability         3      7\n4 abney           1      5\n5 absence         1      7\n6 acccurately     1     11\n\n\n\n\nFrom Stack overflow\n“The best way to do this is to use a tool to tag your plural nouns, and then to convert these to singular. Unlike the stemmer solution, this will not stem words such as stemming to stem, or quickly to quick, etc.I recommend using the spacyr package for this, which integrates nicely with quanteda.”\nYet, there are a few steps required for this to work, as detailed in Running Python Chunks in RStudio and rmarkdown. After that you could also watch this YouTube Tutorial.\nRaw Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngls <- as.data.frame(pq_dat %>%\n  unnest_tokens(output = word, input = answers)%>%\n  anti_join(stop_words, by = \"word\")%>%\n  filter(str_detect(word,\"[:alpha:]\"))%>%\n  distinct() %>% \n  count(word, sort = TRUE))\nhead(gls)\n\n            word  n\n1           fire 44\n2       wildfire 29\n3          water 21\n4        cycling 20\n5        impacts 20\n6 biogeochemical 18\n\n\n“Clean” Data\n\n\n\n\n\nWe used the function anti_join to remove stop words. We also want to remove numbers (like year of publication). To do so we use the combination of filter and str_detec to preserve only alphabetic characters \"[:alpha:]\". Finally, to make sure we are not double counting words, we use the function distinct.\nGlossary\nBesides identifying the words that are more frequently used in the answers, we could use our dataset to create a consistent glossary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n      \n    Word \n    Frequency \n  \n \n\n  \n    1 \n    fire \n    44 \n  \n  \n    2 \n    wildfire \n    29 \n  \n  \n    3 \n    water \n    21 \n  \n  \n    4 \n    cycling \n    20 \n  \n  \n    5 \n    impacts \n    20 \n  \n  \n    6 \n    biogeochemical \n    18 \n  \n  \n    1073 \n    world \n    1 \n  \n  \n    1074 \n    wu \n    1 \n  \n  \n    1075 \n    wuis \n    1 \n  \n  \n    1076 \n    xanes \n    1 \n  \n  \n    1077 \n    xas \n    1 \n  \n  \n    1078 \n    yosemite \n    1 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nTo do so, we could use a frequency filter; including words above a frequency threshold (e.g. 2)\n\ngls_fw <- filter(gls, n > 2)\ngls_fwp <- rbind(head(gls_fw),tail(gls_fw))\ncolnames(gls_fwp) <- c(\"Word\", \"Frequency\")\nknitr::kable(gls_fwp,format=\"html\") %>% \n   html_table_width(c(200,200))\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n      \n    Word \n    Frequency \n  \n \n\n  \n    1 \n    fire \n    44 \n  \n  \n    2 \n    wildfire \n    29 \n  \n  \n    3 \n    water \n    21 \n  \n  \n    4 \n    cycling \n    20 \n  \n  \n    5 \n    impacts \n    20 \n  \n  \n    6 \n    biogeochemical \n    18 \n  \n  \n    201 \n    supply \n    3 \n  \n  \n    202 \n    traditional \n    3 \n  \n  \n    203 \n    transported \n    3 \n  \n  \n    204 \n    types \n    3 \n  \n  \n    205 \n    variation \n    3 \n  \n  \n    206 \n    vary \n    3 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nWe still have a long list of words that are not necessarily associated to wildfires. We can look into different associations to get collections of keywords. Bit before that, we will start with term frequencies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nWords with low frequency make a large contribution to the text.\nWe observe deviations from the Zipf’s law both at the higher rank words (rare)and the lower rank words (more common). On the one hand, we have more words than expected at higher ranks, and less words than expected at lower ranks. This is perhaps the effect of abundant technical terms in the corpus analyzed here.\nAnalyzing word’s frequencies using Zipf’s law seems to have some drawbacks, see: Zipf’s law holds for phrases, not words. However the unnest_tokens function can also be applied to sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    ID \n    question \n    sentences \n  \n \n\n  \n    IA0001 \n    pressing-q \n    better understanding of the temporal scales of the different impacts as well as their potential interactions movement of materials ash, pyrogenic carbon, eroded soil between compartments  from hillslopes to the hydrological network as well as physical and biological alterations of those during the transport \n  \n  \n    IA0002 \n    pressing-q \n    how are flow pathways affected by wildfires  change of hydrological processes beyond vegetation removal? \n  \n  \n    IA0002 \n    pressing-q \n    how long do changes in hydrology and biogeochemistry last? \n  \n  \n    IA0002 \n    pressing-q \n    including importance of forest disturbance history \n  \n  \n    IA0003 \n    pressing-q \n    how important are deeper groundwater flowpaths for prolonging elevated nutrient yields in burned watersheds? \n  \n  \n    IA0003 \n    pressing-q \n    the vast majority of post-wildfire studies on biogeochemical cycling have focused on surface or shallow flowpaths, yet post-fire geochemical tracers indicate elevated contributions from deeper bedrock flowpaths during some hydroclimatic conditions murphy  2018. \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA function from the tidytext package that aims to find the most common words in a text by decreasing the weight of the most common terms and increasing it for the less common (i.e. meeting in the middle scenario)\n“The logic of tf-idf is that the words containing the greatest information about a particular document are the words that appear many times in that document, but in relatively few others.”\nIt is meant to be for document intercomparison.

    "text": "Bookdown to Quarto\nConverting a Bookdown book to Quarto is slightly more involved than converting a website. A book has chapters whose order must be defined, and likely has citations and cross-refs. Still, conversion is not that hard.\nWe got some practice converting from Bookdown to Quarto by helping Gavin Fay convert his lab’s fantastic onboarding documentation, the Faylab Lab Manual. Here’s the GitHub view before and after.\nOur best first reference material for this was Nick Tierney’s Notes on Changing from Rmarkdown/Bookdown to Quarto. Nick shares some scripts in that post to automate some changes. In our case, the book was small enough that we made all changes manually. Quarto documentation was indispensable.\n\nExperimenting in a low-risk environment\nWe forked a copy of the Faylab Lab manual to the Openscapes organization, and worked in a branch so we could make changes relatively risk-free. We could always fork a new copy of the original if we “broke” something. (Caution: the default when making a pull request from a fork is to push changes to the original upstream repo, not your fork and it does this without warning if you have write-access to that repo.) With local previews it’s easy to test / play with settings to see what they do. We tended to make a change, Preview, then compare the look and functionality of the book to the original. It was helpful to comment out some elements of the configuration file _output.yml after their counterparts had been added to the Quarto configuration file _quarto.yml, or to confirm they were no longer needed, before making the drastic move of deleting them.\n\n\nThe conversion\nHere are the main steps to convert the Faylab Lab manual from Bookdown to Quarto.\nCreate new empty file called _quarto.yml and add book metadata there. The screenshots below\nSet project type as book.\nMove metadata out of index.qmd and into _quarto.yml. Title, author, and publication date were in index.qmd with date set using date: \"Last updated:r Sys.Date()\". Now these are in _quarto.yml with date set using date: last-modified. Note that having R code would require you to adjust code chunk options in the Quarto style (#|). This tripped us up a bit; see GitHub Actions.\nMove chapters listing out of _bookdown.yml and into _quarto.yml.\nAdd page footer to _quarto.yml.\nHere’s what ours looked like when we finished the steps above (_quarto.yml).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaylab Lab Manual\n\n\n\n\n\nChange insertion of images from html style to Quarto style. (Note Quarto calls them “figures”, not “images”.) The following snippet will insert the GitHub octocat logo in a page:\n![](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png){fig-align=\"left\" width=\"35px\"}\nChange all filename extensions .Rmd -> .qmd (you could Preview after this change and see that the book looks the same). Note that Quarto works with .Rmd files just as well as it does .qmd, so this change is not urgent. In fact, if you have a lot of R code in your .Rmds (unlike the Faylab Lab Manual), there will be additional tinkering needed to make the code chunks happy.\n\n\nCitations\nThe Faylab Lab Manual cited two papers, presenting us with an opportunity to see how easy it is to add references to a Quarto book. Briefly, in the Visual Editor, Insert > Citation > DOI. Pasting the DOI or its full URL, we can insert the citation. This automatically creates a references.bib file and adds the full citations at the bottom of the chapter page (watch demo). In July 2022, we had to manually add a ## References heading, but this may not be necessary in future Quarto updates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsert citation via its DOI using RStudio Visual Editor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublishing notes\nIf the book’s output is strictly html, there’s no need to specify output-dir in _quarto.yml. The output directory default is _book/, which is what we’d like. If we wanted other types of output like like PDF or EPUB, etc. those single file outputs are also written to the output-dir (Quarto docs).\nIf you currently have a docs/ folder, delete it.\nUpdate .gitignore to ignore _book/. At the same time, we have it ignore caches and a .quarto file:\n/.quarto/\n*_cache/\n_book/\nOnce all is settled, delete _output.yml.\nOnce the Openscapes fork was fully reviewed, we made a pull request from that to the main branch of the book’s repo. Once that was merged, we set up GitHub Actions to render the book. (TODO: instructions for GitHub Actions)\n\n\nGitHub Actions\nThis book was mostly prose and screenshots without any R code. This made the conversion from RMarkdown to Quarto likely more straightforward than if you also needed to adjust code chunk options in the quarto style (#|). Our initial GitHub Action to render the converted Faylab Lab Manual failed because we had a piece of R code - even though the code was commented out! This was resolved when we deleted the line."

    "text": "Distill to quarto\nWe transitioned our events site from distill to quarto in May 2022 (github view before and after). We followed excellent notes and examples from Nick Tierney and Danielle Navarro.\nAfter we had changed all the files, the Build tab in the RStudio IDE still showed “Build website” rather then “Render Website” and “Preview Website”, and would error when we pushed them (because that button was expecting a distill site, not a quarto site). To fix this, we updated the .Rproj file. Clicking on the .Rproj file in the RStudio IDE will open a dialog box where you can click things you want (you can also open these in a text editor or from the GitHub website to see the actual text). To fix this situation with the Build tab: Project Options > Build Tools > Project Build Tools > None.\nLooking at files /posts/_metadata.yml and _quarto.yml helps see where things are defined. For example, to make event post citations appear, we added citation: true to /posts/_metadata.yml and in _quarto.yml under the website key we set site-url: https://openscapes.github.io/events. We deleted footer.html used with distill because footer is now defined in quarto.yml.\n\nPublishing notes\n\nBackground: Our distill site had been set up to output to a docs folder, and had GitHub Settings > Pages set to look there rather gh-pages branch. (Julie note: this was a new-to-me capability when we set up the events distill site in Spring 2021 so I had forgotten that was an option). We’ve inititally kept this same set-up for now with our events page in _quarto.yml: output-dir: docs. However, this is sub-optimal; better to not have to commit and push these files but to instead have a GitHub Action generate them upon a commit. So the following is what we did -\n\nDon’t specify output-dir in _quarto.yml. The output directory default is _site/, which is what we’d like.\nIf you currently have a docs/ folder (like we did as we were experimenting), delete it.\nUpdate .gitignore to ignore _site/. At the same time, we have it ignore caches and a .quarto file:\n/.quarto/\n*_cache/\n_site/\nPush these changes, merge into main.\nOn GitHub.com, in your repo, set up GitHub publishing\nFollow instructions from the explore and setup chapter."
