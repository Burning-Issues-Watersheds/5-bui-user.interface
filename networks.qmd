#### Take a look at the word cloud networks & respond in the comment box in the link above!

These have been created based on your responses to the survey questions. There is a word cloud for: 1) the pressing questions 2) the roadblocks and 3) the pathways for wildfires and watershed science.

1.  ðŸ”¥ What connections jump out for the burning issues? (10 words or less per "burning issue")
2.  ðŸ”¥ What connections do you see for roadblocks? (10 words or less per roadblock)
3.  ðŸ”¥ What connections do you see for pathways? (10 words or less per pathway)
4.  ðŸ”¥ What connections do you see across the questions? i.e. which pathways could address which roadblocks? Which burning issues could be addressed by which pathways, etc?
